# End-to-End E-commerce Data Pipeline

## Abstract
This project showcases the successful implementation of an end-to-end data pipeline and data warehousing solution. We utilized CSV files to load data into the OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database, overcoming challenges in mapping relations and performing table joins to accurately represent the source data. 
Additionally, we gained valuable insights into the implementation and importance of a data warehouse (DW). We also learned how to make intriguing visualizations using data from the warehouse to aid decision-making.

## Key Learnings and Implementations
* Loading data from CSV files into the OLTP database.
* Properly mapping relations and performing table joins to represent source data.
* Understanding the fundamentals of data warehousing and its implementation.
* Creating Fact and Dimension tables to efficiently retrieve required data with minimal joins.
* Implementing incremental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) for resource efficiency and data updates.
* Utilizing AWS S3 bucket for data storage and integrating it with the Snowflake data warehouse.
* Uncovering the complexities of building a flawless end-to-end data pipeline.
* Leveraging Tableau for data visualization and providing insights to end users and decision-makers.
* Enhancing programming skills and collaboration through project execution.
